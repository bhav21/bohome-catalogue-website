## BOHOME

This simple catalogue website was created as part of my coursework at Seneca College. The website uses HTML and the DOM to generate both static as well as dynamic content. To simulate working with a database, the project uses JavaScript Objects and Arrays. 

The styling of the page is done by incorporating sakura.css, a minimal classless css theme (github repo: https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura/)
